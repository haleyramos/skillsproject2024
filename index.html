      <h3>The 20th century was packed with action. Both science and history were barrelling along,
           with events of great importance to the human condition occurring back to back to back. Among
           those events was the discovery of life's code. Understanding DNA's structure and workings
           have led to a complete upheaval of how we see ourselves and other animals. For many, the names
           Watson and Crick are associated with this milestone discovery. However, not as many know the fuller
           story of the scientist who overcame all odds to even get to the starting point.
           Our understanding of DNA started with her, the one who really snapped the picture.</h3>

      <p>Dr. Rosalind Franklin was not only the British crystollagrapher famous for her contributions to
        the discovery of the structure of DNA, but a prolific chemist, too. She was a scientist
        in the truest sense of the word, seeking to understand the world through reason and bring 
        advancement through research.</p>
