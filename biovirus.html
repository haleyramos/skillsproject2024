    <p class="sub">Franklin also contributed much to virology. She determined the structure of tobacco mosaic virus, a virus that harms
         tobacco plants. It set the model for other viruses of the rod shape from then on. Importantly, she also determined the structure
          of the polio virus, a major killer at the time.</p>
