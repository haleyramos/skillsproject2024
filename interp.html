    <h2>Her Own Results</h2>
    <p class="sub">The chemical structure of DNA was determined by analyzing Photograph 51. Separate papers breaking down and explaining 
        the results by Watson and Crick and Franklin and Gosling were all published in the same issue of Nature, a well-known British 
        scientific journal. Watson and Cricks paper was published in front of Franklin's, and mentioned her contributions as a mere side 
        note. Their access to her image and data was passed to them without her knowledge.</p>
